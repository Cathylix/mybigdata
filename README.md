# mybigdata
There are three big data analysis examples.

# 1. R and Graph Analytics
Data Set:Social networks related to Facebook users (anonymized).<br />
Objective:This is a very large data set (4000+ nodes, 80,0000+ edges). You may have to simplify the graph somewhat in order to execute this project. If so, describe how you simplified the graph. You may use the simplify function, but you may have to do more than that.

# 2. Exploring Variations in Clustering and Predictive Analysis
Data Set:WineQuality.(Red,White).csv<br />
Objective: There are two data sets. Your job is to character white wines versus red wines by applying clustering and classification techniques as well as additional functions from the packages mentioned.

# Text Analytics in R
Data Set: acq<br />
Objective: The problem is to process a large set of documents (50) to understand how text analytics works.
